        <h2>Brief</h2>
        <p class="article">
            PIE is a platform that uses the capabilities of blockchain in order to make
            secure cryptocurrency-based donations to charities. The platform keeps
            charities accountable for their transactions through ledgers. We wanted to
            empower users on the platform to donate to causes they care about,
            with the ability to vote on proposals or causes that matter to them.
        </p>

        <table class="user-story">

            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>I want to:</th>
                <td>track what my donation is being used towards</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>So that:</th>
                <td>I can confirm that my money is used towards the cause I
                    am passionate about and keep charities accountable</td>

        <h2>Wireframes</h2>

        <p class="article">
            After defining our problem and user story, I got right into wireframing. My challenge
            in the beginning was mostly understanding how blockchain functioned. Coming from a
            non-technical background, it was hard for me to make informed design decisions without
            firstly understanding the core of our product.
        </p>

        <p class="article">
            Once that was understood, I eagerly moved on to creating wireframes!
        </p>

        <h1>Final Designs & Outcomes</h1>
        <br>

        <h2>Dashboard</h2>
        <br>
        <img class="hack-img" src="images/pie/fin1.png">

        <p class="article">
            The dashboard is the homepage a user lands on after signing in. In contains data from all the
            charities they support and how much money they are raising. There is basic info about their
            balances like with most financial applications, with CTAs to donate.
        </p>

        <br><br>

        <h2>Donation Flow</h2>
        <br>
        <img class="hack-img" src="images/pie/fin2.png">

        <p class="article">
            The donation flow is simple, and places a focus on the charity option rather than
            the blockchain. In order to make the experience more welcoming, we wanted the fact that
            the platform was based in crypto to be a lesser detail. The main purpose after all, is making
            charitable donations.
        </p>

        <br><br>

        <h2>Charity Profile</h2>
        <br>
        <img class="hack-img" src="images/pie/fin3.png">

        <p class="article">
            From the front page or after donation, you can view a charity's profile to track their spend
            history. This way, users have more transparency into where their money is going, and therefore
            increasing trust between the organization and customer.
        </p>

        <h2>Takeaways</h2>
        <br>
        <p class="article">
            I really learned a lot about blockchain in this weekend! From knowing nothing to being able
            to explain it in general terms to a beginner is great in my book. The challenge here was
            really designing something I had little knowledge about. I had to go off a lot of assumptions,
            especially with the time restraints of a hackathon. It has definitely made me appreciate UX
            designers in more technical industries, which would require knowledge in those fields as well.
