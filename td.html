        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p class="article">
            TD Small Business banking was the solution my team and I developed
            during uXperience Design Camp 2018, a high-intensity design and business
            competition working on real-world problems. The event itself lasted
            for 12 hours, with 8 hours allocated for participants to work on their
            solutions and pitches. The design challenge was presented by TD Bank,
            one of the competition’s main sponsors.
        </p>

        <p class="article">
            My team and I placed first out of over 20 teams, and here’s how we did it!
        </p>

        <br><br>

        <h2>The Challenge</h2>
        <br>
        <div class="goals-row">
            <div class="goal">
                <h3 style="color: #726ACD;opacity: 1;">How might we reward small
                    business banking customers for their ongoing business and
                    relationship so that they are incentivized to centralize
                    financial tasks with TD?</h3>

        <h2>Design Process</h2>
        <p class="article">
            In order to find the best solution to this problem, and provide the
            best experience for the end users for our product, we implemented
            a design-thinking process.

        <h2>Empathize - Research</h2>
        <p class="article">
            Taking into account the time limit of the competition, user interview research,
            competitive analyses, affinity maps, and user personas were provided to us.
            TD interviewed many small business owners and gathered data about how they
            feel about their relationship with banking. The user interview feedback was
            collected in an affinity map and later synthesized in user personas.
        </p>
        <p class="article">
            The provided user personas have been separated in 3, for varying levels of
            expertise/comfort with finance. We were also given a table of competitor
            loyalty programs, to assess their systems and how they reward their customers.
            We took all this information in and gathered insights.

        <h2>Define - Gathering Insights</h2>
        <p class="article">
            For the first half of the competition, my team and I analyzed the data in
            order to determine the main pain points and needs of the users. We focused
            on the personas and affinity map, brainstormed on whiteboards and sticky
            notes together, and highlighted the most mentioned frustrations and goals.

        <h2>Ideate</h2>

        <p class="article">
            After defining our problem, we got started with brainstorming what our digital
            solution can look like. We ideated on the types of reward systems our app
            can provide, and different ways to incentivize the users to use TD products.

            I proposed performing an information architecture card sorting activity,
            that would allow us to find a way to structure our app to maximize usability.

        <h3>Wireframing and Iteration</h3>

        <p class="article">
            Every team member created low fidelity wireframes based from these previous
            determinations. We iterated through different versions of each screen.
            The ones below are the wireframes I sketched out, and I focused on iterations
            of the community page of the app.

                    completing tasks, like setting up a payroll with TD, and the higher their rank, the

        <br>

        <p class="article">
            I pitched the solution at uXperience Design Camp 2018 with two other teammates,
            highlighting the value proposition of our product, and our design decisions that
            would benefit the users. We had a very fun experience working together, and energetically
            debating our many design ideas.

        <br><br>

        <h2>Takeaways</h2>

        <p class="article">
            Through the mentorship provided by the two sponsors at this event, Deloitte Digital
            and TD Labs, I learned a lot about finance, collaborating with other designers, and
            how to better identify goals from user data. We also received advice on how to pitch
            in order appeal to stakeholders, and focus on the important aspects of the project.
        </p>

        <p class="article">
            If we had more time to work on the project, I would have enjoyed expanding the app,
            and exploring more in depth on how community interactions may look like. I believe it
            would have also been valuable to be able to test the application with real business
            owners, and gather their thoughts about how they feel about a product like the one
            we developed.
