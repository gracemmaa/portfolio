        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p class="article">
            TD Small Business banking was the solution my team and I developed
            during uXperience Design Camp 2018, a high-intensity design and business
            competition working on real-world problems. The event itself lasted
            for 12 hours, with 8 hours allocated for participants to work on their
            solutions and pitches. The design challenge was presented by TD Bank,
            one of the competition’s main sponsors.
        </p>

            My team and I placed first out of over 20 teams, and here’s how we did it!

                <h3 style="color: #726ACD;opacity: 1;">How might we reward small
                    business banking customers for their ongoing business and
                    relationship so that they are incentivized to centralize
                    financial tasks with TD?</h3>
