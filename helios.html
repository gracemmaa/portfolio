        <h2>Brief</h2>
        <p class="article">
            Helios is a platform that connects entrepreneurial students and individuals
            together to build side projects and startup businesses. Its aim is to aggregate
            talented and passionate people to create a network where everyone shares the
            same drive to improve their skills and gain experience.

        <h2>Timelines - Working with time and dev constraints</h2>
        <img src="images/helios/process.png" class="hack-img">
        <p class="article">
            We started the first iteration of the project building from our assumptions.
            In order to keep our devs utilized and meet our deadlines, the design team
            made initial designs which would be iterated on afterwards.

        <h2>Our Assumptions</h2>
        <br>

        <h3>Assumption 1</h3>
        <p class="article">
            People who would use our platform are already looking to start or join a side
            project, mostly students.
        </p>

        <br>

        <h3>Assumption 2</h3>
        <p class="article">
            With our product, people and projects are aggregated on our platform.
            The expected user behaviour is that they would look through the list of
            available projects and roles.
        </p>

        <h3>Outcome</h3>
        <p class="article">
            We prioritized displaying projects as a result. Here were some initial explorations done by my
            teammate, Emma.

        <p class="article">
            And we made more iterations to make the experience simpler.

        <br>

        <h3>Assumption 3</h3>
        <p class="article">
            Profiles are less prioritized in the information architecture than project
            detail pages. Users are expected to click into projects and contact the
            poster from that page. To get to the profile, users would have to click
            their profile icons, a much smaller, non-obvious action button.
        </p>
        <h3>Outcome</h3>
        <p class="article">
            We designed the project detail page and profile page to reflect this assumption. We de-prioritized
            any information about team and team members from the detail page, and featured projects
            on the profile pages. The wireframes below were explorations from Emma and Yifei.

        <h2>Understanding the user - finally conducting research!</h2>

        <p class="article">
            We interviewed 4 individuals, who ranged from students looking for side projects, to
            startup owners looking for more team members. We asked questions to better understand their
            frustrations and goals when it comes to
