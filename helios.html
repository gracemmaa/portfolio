                Helios is a platform that connects entrepreneurial students and individuals together to build side projects
                and startup businesses. Its aim is to aggregate talented and passionate people to create a network where
                everyone shares the same drive to improve their skills and gain experience.

                As the product design lead, I helped to navigate the project through the design thinking process
                and mentored the designers on the team. I also contributed as a product designer and I helped
                to write the script for user interviews, conduct them, wireframe, and develop the design system.

            <p>
                When students and individuals want to work on side projects together, there isn't a go-to method of
                finding people to work with, or available side projects to join when they don't have an idea themselves.
                They have to reach out to their network and friends which takes time, and not everyone may commit the
                same amount of time to a project.

                To better understand how our users currently navigate starting side projects and the associated pain
                points, I conducted user interviews with the help of 2 designers with 4 participants, ranging from
                students driven to learn to startup owners whose companies began as side projects.

                This page was intentionally designed to have a little interaction as possible, keeping the experience
                of finding a project distraction-free. The main goal of the page is to allow users looking for a project
                to join the ability to browse openings. The CTA to post a button provides a quick and direct access for
                users that have a project but are on the recruiting end.

                In our research, users looked at various factors before considering working on a side project. In order
                to help users make a decision about which projects they'd be interested in before needing to click for
                additional information, I suggested using card components that would preview some information to give
                users more context. We considered using the pattern of a more browsable list as well, but we decided
                against it, as lists were more suited for quick browsing. For the experience of our website, we wanted
                our users to be able to make informed decisions about these side projects.

                Some of our previous iterations were inspired by job board experiences. Though it contained a lot of useful
                features like filters and bookmarking, we went for a simpler experience because our users were likely not
                spending much time on this platform other than for connecting with other driven individuals. So on newer
                iterations on the right, the wireframes were further simplified and we put some thought into the interactions
                and the surfaced data.

                Once a user clicks into a project, they're brought to a detail page that lists out a description and

                This sidebar section is a sticky component, that anchors to the top of the page as a user scrolls down.
                The main goal of the browse project flow is to make a connection between the viewer and the poster so
                that they can work together on the project. As such, I suggested to have the main function of this page
                available to the user at all times, therefore decreasing the friction for a user to meet their goals.

                away from a job application kind of experience. In order to accomplish this, we added a chat feature
                to mimic casual networking or the situation of asking your friends online to participate in a fun
                side project.

                The previous version of this page were inspired by job boards and similar platforms, with the knowledge

                tried a people-focused project details page that gave the user more information about the team.

                Many of the decisions made for this platform have been based on the insights we gathered through our

                test our assumptions and validate the user experience choices that we have made. After that, we would
                need to build out other crucial features for the platform like chat and account creation.

                I learned a lot through this project. It was one of my first times leading other designers on a product
                design team, and I learned how to best communicate with designers and navigate through design ideas
                and decisions. Working on this platform also taught me a lot about user research, which I haven't
                done much of before. I got to experience actively applying the things we learned to the choices we
                made on user experience and interaction patterns. Additionally, we also worked with developers for
                this project, which gave me the experience of working with real, technical constraints and how to hand
                off design documentation so that the developers can work smoothly.
