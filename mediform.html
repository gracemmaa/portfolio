        <h2>Brief</h2>
        <p class="article">
            Mediform is a platform which allows patient to digitize important and
            frequently-used health information and share it effortlessly with
            their healthcare provider. A patient goes through a one-time setup
            process, when they input their personal health information on the app.
            Upon completion, they are able to present a QR code to their healthcare
            provider, which enables them to quickly pull up their medical data.
        </p>

        <br><br>

        <h2>Our Design Process</h2>

        <p class="article">I usually start off a project trying to understand the problem and
        the users. In the case of Mediform, we knew we wanted to tackle a specific problem already
        which members of the team have experienced personally.</p>

        <p class="article">The next plan of action was to better understand the users in order
        to make informed design choices, and we recorded the anecdotes of two users before prototyping.</p>

        <br><br>

        <h2>Initial Research</h2>

        <p class="article">
            We interviewed two individuals to collect anecdotes about their
            health care experiences to better understand the problem space and to
            better inform us of their frustrations.

            While I normally like to ideate by iterating with flow charts and figure out the
            experience before moving on to screens, the time limits for a hackathon do not
            always allow for a detailed UX process. I started with wireframing, and ideated directly
            the frames.
