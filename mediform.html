        <h2>Brief</h2>
        <p class="article">
            Mediform is a platform which allows patient to digitize important and
            frequently-used health information and share it effortlessly with
            their healthcare provider. A patient goes through a one-time setup
            process, when they input their personal health information on the app.
            Upon completion, they are able to present a QR code to their healthcare
            provider, which enables them to quickly pull up their medical data.
        </p>

        <br><br>

        <h2>Our Design Process</h2>

        <p class="article">I usually start off a project trying to understand the problem and
        the users. In the case of Mediform, we knew we wanted to tackle a specific problem already
        which members of the team have experienced personally.</p>

        <p class="article">The next plan of action was to better understand the users in order
        to make informed design choices, and we recorded the anecdotes of two users before prototyping.</p>

        <img class="hack-img" src="images/mediform/mdprocess.svg">
        <p class="caption">Based off the UX double diamond model</p>

        <br><br>

        <h2>Initial Research</h2>

        <p class="article">
            We interviewed two individuals to collect anecdotes about their
            health care experiences to better understand the problem space and to
            better inform us of their frustrations.

            While I normally like to ideate by iterating with flow charts and figure out the
            experience before moving on to screens, the time limits for a hackathon do not
            always allow for a detailed UX process. I started with wireframing, and ideated directly

        <h1>Final Designs & Outcomes</h1>
        <br>

        <h2>The patient flow is a one-click process</h2>
        <br>
        <img class="hack-img" src="images/mediform/fin3.png">

        <p class="article">
            I wanted to make using the app as simple as possible. Right after the one-time onboarding
            process, you just open the app, and tap a large main CTA to open your QR code to check in.
            In order to maximize on efficiency, I wanted to make checking in a one-step process.
        </p>

        <br><br>

        <h2>Optimized form for one-time set-up</h2>
        <br>
        <img class="hack-img" src="images/mediform/fin2.png">

        <p class="article">
            The one-time set-up process that a user will go through looks like a lot of steps, but
            contains all the information they are required to enter. I solutioned upon their frustrations of
            needing to continuously fill out the form by making it something they only do once. I used form best
            practices to build a seamless form experience and lessen expected fatigue that comes with filling out
            long forms.
        </p>

        <br><br>

        <h2>On the clinic side - tap, scan, done!</h2>
        <br>
        <img class="hack-img" src="images/mediform/fin1.png">

        <p class="article">
            Like with the patient flow, we wanted to make the clinic flow as simple as possible as well
            to reduce waiting times and speed the process. The receptionists simply tap on one button to
            pull up a camera interface to scan the patient's QR code. Once scanned, they immediately pull
            up a profile with the patients medical information which can be passed onto the doctor.
        </p>

        <br><br><br><br>
        <br><br><br><br>

        <h2>Takeaways</h2>
        <br>
        <p class="article">
            Overall, DeltaHacks was a fun time! I really believed in our idea and I definitely worked
            harder and sacrificed more sleep than usual for this project. Our project turned out great
            given our limit of 24 hours, but there are definitely more ways to improve if I were to take
            this project forward.
        </p>

        <p class="article">
            If I had more time, I would gather more research to really confirm my hypothesis that the
            communication of medical information is a true blocker to healthcare. I would love to
            interview people on the clinic side to understand their pain points, and see how our product
            can better help them as well.
