        <h2>Brief</h2>
        <p class="article">
            Mediform is a platform which allows patient to digitize important and
            frequently-used health information and share it effortlessly with
            their healthcare provider. A patient goes through a one-time setup
            process, when they input their personal health information on the app.
            Upon completion, they are able to present a QR code to their healthcare
            provider, which enables them to quickly pull up their medical data.
