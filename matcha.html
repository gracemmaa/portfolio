        <h2>Brief</h2>
        <p class="article">
            Food waste is a big problem in today’s world and especially North America.
            Sustainability & reversing the damage we’ve done to our planet is more
            pressing than ever. Our project - Matcha - matches entities such as restaurants,
            suppliers, grocery stores and charities to each other to facilitate food exchange, in order
            to decrease waste.
        </p>

        <p class="article">
            For Elevate Tech Jam, our challenge was to create a finance-based solution in order to
            enable the communities around us. We decided to focus on sustainability.
        </p>

        <br><br><br><br>

        <h2>Understanding the Problem</h2>

        <br>

        <h3>Initial Research - Understanding the Problem of Food Waste</h3>
        <p class="article">
            We started off doing initial research about the food waste problem.
            Some of the statistics we found were alarming.
        </p>
        <p class="article">
            1. The restaurant industry is the largest producer of food waste
        </p>
        <p class="article">
            2. 11.4 million TONS of food is wasted per year in the US alone.
        </p>
        <p class="article">
            3. $25 BILLION dollars (USD) of food is wasted each year.
        </p>


        <br>

        <h3>Our Approach - Food waste is a logistics issue</h3>
        <p class="article">
            Food waste is completely avoidable. Everyone needs food, and solving food waste is a
            matter of redistributing the surplus to those who have a deficit.
        </p>


        <br>

        <h3>The Challenge</h3>

        <div class="goals-row">
            <div class="goal">
                <h3 style="color: #726ACD;opacity: 1;">How might we redistribute food to decrease
                waste, lost capital from food waste, and enable our communities financially?</h3>
            </div>
        </div>

        <br>

        <h3>User Story</h3>

        <table class="user-story">
            <tr>
                <th>As a:</th>
                <td>Small Business Owner</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>I want to:</th>
                <td>Prevent food waste</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>So that:</th>
                <td>I can decrease my carbon footprint and losses from food waste, consequently increasing
                my net profits.</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <br><br>

        <h3>Market Research - What solutions are available?</h3>
        <p class="article">
            We wanted to find out what other applications and services existed to combat the problem of food
            waste. I examined their features and tried to find where our opportunity would lie.
        </p>
        <img src="images/matcha/comp.png" class="hack-img">
        <p class="caption">
            We looked at existing apps that tackled food waste logistically as well.
        </p>

        <br>

        <h3>Insights</h3>

        <p class="article">
            1. Most existing applications facilitate distribution of food only between 2 or 3 channels
        </p>
        <p class="article">
            2. Most target consumers, or non-profits which distribute to consumers.
        </p>


        <br><br>

        <br><br><br><br>

        <h2>The Solution</h2>
        <br><br>

        <h3>The Area of Opportunity for Matcha - Open Marketplace Model</h3>
        <img src="images/matcha/opp.png" class="hack-img">
        <br>
        <p class="article">
            Matcha steps into the industry as an <span style="font-weight: 600">open marketplace</span>.
            Rather than only facilitating food distribution between 2 or 3 channels, all different
            types of businesses can use Matcha to distribute their goods.
        </p>

        <p class="article">
            <span style="font-weight: 600">Restaurants to Consumer and to other Restaurants:</span> Restaurants can distribute uneaten food to
            consumers at a discount. Another avenue of food distribution is selling unused produce to
            other restaurants that may need that particular ingredient.
        </p>
        <p class="article">
            <span style="font-weight: 600">Grocery Store to Consumer and Restaurants:</span>
            Grocery Stores can sell produce that is about to expire or would otherwise be thrown out
            which would be available to purchase by consumers and other small businesses using the app.
        </p>
        <p class="article">
            <span style="font-weight: 600">Farms to Consumer and Restaurants:</span>
            Many farms have produce that look misshapen or otherwise unsuitable for selling in a grocery store,
            but are still completely safe to eat. Produce such as that can be sold at lower prices to restaurants
            and consumers.
        </p>
        <p class="article">
            <span style="font-weight: 600">Non-profits to Consumers:</span>
            Non-profits can sell food at decreased prices. They can use our platform as a way to generate
            more donations to sustain their organization.
        </p>

        <h1>Final Designs & Outcomes</h1>
        <br><br>

        <h2>Buying products from the eco-marketplace</h2>
        <img src="images/matcha/buy.png" class="hack-img">
        <p class="article">
            Our app functions like many online e-commerce platforms, making it easy to use as many users
            already have an existing mental model of how to operate it.
        </p>
        <h3>Next steps for the buyer flow</h3>
        <p class="article">
            Our vision for buying the produce would be to partner with existing delivery companies (Amazon,
            Uber) in order to deliver the items to the purchaser.
        </p>

        <br><br>

        <h2>Selling products in the eco-marketplace</h2>
        <img src="images/matcha/sell.png" class="hack-img">
        <p class="caption">
            This flow was built with the help of my teammate, Jiajia!
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="article">
            Similarly to the buyer flow, selling an item in our marketplace is similar to other
            e-commerce experiences. This minimizes any learning curve or confusion that comes with
            using the app.
        </p>

        <h2>Takeaways</h2>
        <br>
        <p class="article">
            Sustainability is something my team and I are passionate about solving, and it was fulfilling getting
            the chance to work in this problem space over the weekend. Personally, I try to use a reusable
            mug/cup and straw when I can. Overall, I was glad to gain the experience of taking market research
            and analyzing the data with my team to discover where the opportunity for our product lied.
