            <p id="desc">I worked on a feature for an internal design tool that supports design systems and
                improves communication between engineers and designers.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Over the summer, I joined Facebook's Ads and Business pillar as a product design intern.
            I was placed on a team centred around building an internal design tool and improving its
            experience for the many users within the organization. The feature I worked on enabled
            engineers to better understand the work that designers shipped in the context of code,
            emphasizing consistency and ease of use. While this project is under NDA and I cannot
            elaborate on the product itself, I can share a few of the responsibilities that I had
            and what I did to reach my goal.</p>

        <h2>Learning and Growth</h2>
        <p>Finding the best solution for my project involved learning a lot of new concepts and skills,
            getting guidance where needed, taking on tasks and going out of my comfort zone. The first
            phase of my project focused on understanding the main problem I was tackling. This meant
            speaking to numerous cross-functional collaborators to learn more about the product
            itself and have a sense of their pain points and goals. Though these meetings were
            initially conducted with the help of my intern manager, this was an area for growth
            for me as I became more familiar with the work and led these meetings myself later on.</p>
        <br>
        <p>
            A large portion of my time was spent wireframing and iterating on the product feature.
            I had a lot of ideas which I committed to pixels on the screen, and created as much as
            time allowed. I learned how to be a better storyteller when presenting my work in team
            design critique sessions, which I participated in frequently in order to get as much
            valuable feedback as I could. After creating numerous iterations and an interactive
            prototype for the feature, I validated and tested my assumptions. I wrote a script and
            conducted several user testing sessions which provided me valuable insight that I then
            applied to the next versions of my work.

        <h2>Takeaway</h2>
        <p>My internship with Facebook was certainly challenging. I was solving a problem in a
            completely new space, and there was a lot to learn about the organization itself
            before I could even dive deep on my specific project. Nevertheless, these challenges
            proved to be a huge catalyst for my growth and drove me to perform new tasks and pushed
            me outside of my comfort zone with new experiences. Overall, I learned how to tackle
            problems from a high level before getting into the details, and I've certainly become
            more familiar with collaborating cross-functionally.</p>
