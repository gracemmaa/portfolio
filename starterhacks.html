        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p class="article">
            StarterHacks is a beginner-focused hackathon, a weekend-long tech competition that allows
            students to work together to build a product and pitch their ideas to judges. We focus
            on promoting inclusivity, collaboration, and education, and make efforts to welcome
            students of all backgrounds to experience the tech industry.
        </p>

        <h1>Design Director (May 2018 to May 2019)</h1>

        <p class="article">
            One of my first tasks as Design Director at StarterHacks was to envision the branding for
            the 2019 season of the event to reflect our values, and refresh the website experience
            to meet our objectives. As the lead, I managed the team of 5 to meet deadlines for deliverables
            and make design decisions that would present the best image for our brand.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <br><br>

        <h2>The Challenge</h2>
        <br>
        <div class="goals-row">
            <div class="goal">
                <h3 style="color: #726ACD;opacity: 1;">How might we engage stakeholders and attract
                    interest in our event, and provide a welcoming physical and digital experience?</h3>

        <h2>Our Brand</h2>
        <br>
        <br>

        <h3>Responsive & Accessible Logos</h3>
        <p class="article">
            Knowing that the StarterHacks logo would be used on various digital channels, our
            logo was designed by last year’s design team to be responsive, and be adaptable
            to fit more than just a horizontal space. This would allow for the logo to
            scale to a mobile format later on. Black and white variations of the logo were
            provided to keep the logo visible depending on the surface it would be placed on.

        <br><br>


        <h3>Colour Palette</h3>
        <p class="article">
            StarterHacks has 3 main colours, representing the streams of hackers at our event:
            Engineering (pink), Design (blue), and Business (green). Yellow is our accent colour.
            Taking into account our heavy use of gradients in our vector style, we also included
            light and dark variations of our main colour to be used together to create gradients.
            The light and dark shades also make our design more accessible.

        <h3>Wireframes</h3>

        <p class="article">
            Our team brainstormed different layouts to present information on our site,
            and created low fidelity wireframes collaboratively on Figma. The wireframe
            I made is the on the “Grace” artboard.

        <h3>Adding Delightful Illustrations</h3>

        <p class="article">
            Our website design strongly emphasized using vector illustrations.
            We incorporated our vibrant colour palette to make the illustrations fun, and included
            plant motifs to represent the growth and learning that our hackathon provides to
            first-time hackers.  The illustrations below are the ones I contributed to the website.

        <h2>Final Designs & Outcomes</h2>
        <br>

        <h3>Making navigation efficient with a sticky(ish) header</h3>
        <img src="images/sh/sticky.gif" class="hack-img">
        <br>
        <p class="article">
            Another design choice my team and I made was to set the website as one
            continuous scroll. This was decided for multiple reasons:
        </p>

        <p class="article" style="font-weight: 600;">
            1. Decrease the number of clicks necessary to navigate our site.
        </p>

        <p class="article" style="font-weight: 600;">
            2. Guide the user through the page using layout and vertical format, with call-to-action
            buttons in between.
        </p>

        <br><br>

        <h3>Nurturing trust in our event with attendee testimonials</h3>

        <img src="images/sh/w9.png" class="hack-img">
        <p class="article">
            With hacker engagement in mind, my team and I decided to feature the experiences
            of past hackers to appeal to potential new hackers. We wanted to present the
            StarterHacks experience through the perspective of someone who was there in person.

        <h1>Product Designer (May 2019 to Present)</h1>

        <p class="article">
            For the 2020 cycle of StarterHacks, I decided to work as a member of the team as I would
            have to work remotely. I have been assigned several projects for the term - I am responsible
            for the new website design, building the design system for all our applications, and creating
            the judging app experience!
        </p>

        <p class="article">
            Our website is still a work in progress, but we're pushing v1 of our website soon!
            This year, our focus is on growth. We really want to show the impact of StarterHacks and
            how we've played a part in nurturing the tech talent of tomorrow through inclusion,
            curiosity, and collaboration.
        </p>

        <br><br>

        <h3 style="text-align: center;">I'm still working on all the projects for this year of
        StarterHacks, and I'm excited to share once everything's done!</h3>

        <h2>Takeaways</h2>
        <p class="article">
            I learned a lot from designing the StarterHacks website, and it definitely improved my
            skills in teamwork and communication. Through leading a team, I learned to be more thoughtful
            with my decision-making. I also worked closely with developers, and working with StarterHacks
            was my first learning experience on how to collaborate with developers, understand how they work,
            and communicate efficiently knowing such. I’m delighted to have had the chance to use my
            visual/graphic design skills towards the many vector illustrations for this project as well.
        </p>

        <br><br>

        <h3>Next Steps</h3>
        <p class="article">
            My journey with StarterHacks is not yet over! For my next steps, I plan to work closely with the
            website developers to produce a great digital experience for those who land on our page. I'm
            also excited to build the upcoming judging app to help make the judging experience seamless.
